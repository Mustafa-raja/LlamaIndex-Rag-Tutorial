The latest version (SAP ERP 6.0) was made available in 2006, which has been deployed in  the University with Enhancement Package (EHP7). \nHaving the SAP infrastructure in place has sped up any in-house \ndevelopment efforts because the SAP development tools are fairly easy to learn and there is a lot you can do to customize the system and build on extra functionality. Being able to do this has enhanced our return on investment in the SAP product. It has also simplified the technical support basis and account management for all these functions in one place. Our SAP system is extremely robust and we\u2019ve had virtually no downtime during service hours since we implemented it.\nSAP-ERP makes UOL a forerunner in modernizing student data \nmanagement services within Pakistan.LIBRARY FACILITIES\nThe University\u2019s library resources include books, journals and e-books.

We strive for excellence in the development of software that exhibits the characteristics of quality, reliability and cost-effectiveness that is expected from any well-engineered product.Department of\nSoftware Engineering\nHoD\u2019s MESSAGE\nIt is a pleasure to head the Department of Software Engineering at the University of Lahore. We realize the rapid changes in software engineering, which can be either the context, requirement, technology, or development. However, we believe that if a student is clear and thorough about the fundamentals can adapt to the quick changes. We desire the education imparted to our students to be the basis of their lifetime learning. Learning is a continuous process and does not end with the acquisition of a degree. Steady and rapid advances in computing technologies shorten the life of software tools and techniques used today. Consequently, we do not aim to make our students walk manuals of any language. Instead, they are given a strong foundation in software problem-solving techniques and are made adaptable to changes. I attribute this success to the winning combination of a dedicated faculty that works hard at imparting quality education. It focuses on the latest curriculum based on transferring Knowledge, Skill acquisition, and development of the right Aptitude of students. Hence, our graduates have excelled in the highly competitive industrial environment. I welcome you to make the best educational choice. That will help you grow as a successful human being.\nProf. Dr. Ibrar Hussain\nPhD from Zhejiang University, P.R.

The world is looking towards the microbiologists for their discoveries regarding vaccines and therapeutics. It is just one side of the picture. In general, the scope of microbiology cannot be pen down in a single document. The food you eat, contains microorganisms. If they are not up to the standard, you get sick because of bad microbes. Similarly, if the hygiene of the body is compromised, the pathogens will evade it. Moreover, the whole biosphere including air, water, land, atmosphere contains their respective microorganism which help to sustain the environment by regularizing the biogeochemical cycles as well as establishing the healthy ecosystem.

Imbued with a belief that knowledge has no frontiers, boundaries, and borders, SISS is well on its way to churning out knowledge-producers instead of knowledge-consumers. This, SISS believes, is a continuous, challenging process, one that is typified by student-centered, research-driven, and interactive pedagogy methodologies. Five years after its establishment, SISS boasts having a vibrant student-body, comprising both Pakistani and international students. In addition to offering a popular, ever-expanding four-year undergraduate program, SISS has launched a three-year doctoral program in International Relations. Given that SISS has consistently played an instrumental role in bridging the gap between policymaking and academia while encouraging its students and faculty to focus on producing policy-relevant, original academic works, it believes that its students, faculty, and alumni have the potential to contribute positively to Pakistan\u2019s intellectual capital, response and capacity, which is critical to dominating the all-important but ignored spheres of narrative-building and perception management. The School of Integrated Social Sciences offers a unique combination of four specializations in the BS program, as well as a doctoral degree in International Relations. It aims at fulfilling the following objectives: \n\u2022 To expand the knowledge-base and understandings about \nbroader defense, political, social, economic, security, foreign policy, governance, and sustainable development issues. \n\u2022 To enhance the ability of students to conceptualize problems and apply analytical tools to solve them. \n\u2022 To enhance understanding about the convergence and conflict of interest that shapes international relations and structuring of global politics, challenges to sustainability of development in the 21st century, social change, and issues in governance and public policy. \n\u2022 To provide tools to sharpen critical thinking and development of skills for discourse analysis. \n\u2022 To counsel on personal and career development goals. \n\u2022 To provide a supportive and professional learning environment.HoD\u2019s MESSAGE\nAs the founding Director and Head of Department of the School of Integrated Social Sciences (SISS), I am immensely proud that we have remained firmly committed to adopting a unique, student-centered, and interdisciplinary approach to teaching social sciences. Believing that the burgeoning youth of Pakistan must produce knowledge, I am happy to note SISS is well on its way to producing a crop of socially-cognizant knowledge-producers. Here, I must say, it is a long, continuous, and challenging process, one that demands of us a commitment to research-driven and interactive pedagogical approaches to learning and teaching. Today, SISS boasts having a diverse, exuberant student-body comprising national and international students. We are hosting 120 Afghan students on Allama Iqbal Scholarships studying in BS Social Sciences Politics and International Relations degree program. Our PhD in International Relations program is gaining a reputation for being one of the best doctoral IR programs offered in Pakistan.

These challenges are both at home and at international level. But it is unfortunate that traditional institutions have failed in genuine contribution for the solution of prevalent problems and proper response to the contemporary challenges. Furthermore, the traditional religious institutions have created a divide in the society. The new generation educated through modern educational institutes and universities and those who are trained in traditional religious madrassas are poles apart in their understanding of Islamic teachings and their approach towards contemporary issues too. A comprehensive course which may have merits of both of these systems can bridge the gap. The University of Lahore has established the Department of Islamic Studies with the same vision and objectives that we may produce such learned scholars for society who have grip on the tradition and may have a mature understanding of the contemporary issues with a clear and perfect skill in the modern thoughts and academic approaches. These scholars will be able to present Islam in accordance with its real spirit before society.MISSION STATEMENT\nProduce such learned scholars for society who have grip on the tradition and may have a mature understanding of the contemporary issues with a clear and perfect skill in the modern thoughts and academic approaches.HoD\u2019s MESSAGE\nPursuit of Islamic education and learning constructs a spiritual blend of ethical contribution and pragmatic response to the threats posed by modern day challenges such as stigma of terrorism and fundamentalism.  The department trains the students to develop Islamic values ,social morals ,ethics and skills that help to play a diligent part in all avenues of life to build a cohesive, proud and sovereign nation. The syllabus thus designed fully aims at restoration of true and classical Islamic education that is the pivot of an exemplary Islamic society. Department of Islamic Studies aims to be recognized as the Islamic world knowledge hub that promotes world class research, teaching and learning environment by some highly conceptual and practical research programs led by an efficient faculty including as many as seventeen PhDs for competent and efficient students. It intends to enable students to serve as truly faithful Muslims  according to the pattern of Allah\u2019s Messenger and his Companions, act graciously and patiently ; condemn sectarian violence and answer the tough contemporary propositions in a prophetic manner and with monumental prudence .The department tries to wipe of the innovations and unveils the innocent ,flawless Islam conveyed and practiced by the Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H).The ingredients include  commitment to respect, care for and serve others; an Islam secured not by attachment to communal identity but by attachment to Allah. The department  wants to develop and support harmony between different religions and sects of society and to relate to others with tolerance, respect and consideration, whatever their beliefs and attitudes may be.\nProf. Dr. Naseer Ahmad Akhtar\n186\nThe University of Lahore 187\nwww.uol.edu.pk", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5072, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d5b9456-f8f0-44cb-859a-a704d367110e": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d5b9456-f8f0-44cb-859a-a704d367110e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "UOL Prospectus 2023-24.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mustafaraja/Documents/GitHub/LlamaIndex-Rag-Tutorial/data/UOL Prospectus 2023-24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7549339, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66bb4762-0d82-4491-98d3-4b7b6ddfa167", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "UOL Prospectus 2023-24.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mustafaraja/Documents/GitHub/LlamaIndex-Rag-Tutorial/data/UOL Prospectus 2023-24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7549339, "creation_date": "2024-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-29"}, "hash": "c23d66ba11d1d9a910ad8251b6ca83f3418f91d9edfa869c6533e443169107c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f529c629-82b0-4673-9f40-397568e2991c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bfafbb86181aa6cf5e51d780e0f34547e4fbd24c8f1da3ef456a09fda56a1d62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Bachelor of \nIslamic Studies\nEntry Requirements\n\u2022 12 Years of Education, Intermediate with minimum 2nd Division from any recognized educational board from Govt. of the Pakistan or Assanwia Alkhasa with equivalence certificate issued by recognized authority.Program Duration: 4 YearsTiming:  Morning (Monday - Thursday)\nLocation:  Defence Road Campus, Lahore.\nRecognized By: Higher Education Commission\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Bachelor of Science (BS) program in Islamic Studies is four year (eight semesters) program.
